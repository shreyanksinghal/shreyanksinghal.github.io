                    with "<a href="/wiki/Pilot_(Rick_and_Morty)" title="Pilot (Rick and Morty)">Pilot</a>" and ended on

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Rick convinces his daughter, Beth, and his son-in-law, Jerry, to allow their son, Morty, to continue
                    following him in his interdimensional adventures, promising that this will improve his school
                    performance. Morty, his parents and his sister, Summer, are dragged into dangerous adventures
                    throughout
                    the multiverse, which they manage to escape mostly thanks to Rick's ingenuity.<br><br>

                    When Rick and Morty accidentally turn the population of Earth into monsters, they move to an
                    alternate
                    dimension where the disaster was averted, leaving Beth, Jerry and Summer behind. They adapt to a
                    seemingly identical reality, as they take the place of alternate versions of themselves who died
                    moments
                    before their arrival. It is revealed that Rick keeps using Morty as his companion, because his
                    inferior
                    brain waves neutralize Rick's genius brain waves, making him undetectable. When Beth and Jerry go on
                    vacation, Rick and the kids have a party with numerous guests that turn the house into a mess. Rick
                    freezes time so that he and the kids can repair the house, before their parents return.</p>
